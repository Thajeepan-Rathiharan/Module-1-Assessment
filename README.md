# Thajeepan Rathiharan's Portfolio Website

This portfolio is made for the project assessment for module 1 of the Front End Developer course, and it is to showcase on the knowledge I have gained from the lessons in the module about writing in HTML and CSS coding languages to make a website from scratch. Another thing this website is made for is to be used in the future to showcase my professional work to companies when applying for jobs.  
My website is pretty easy to navigate through as it has a menu bar that takes users to specific pages and the content is all visible throughout all 3 pages of my site with an overall mature design for it including the colour choice. 

## Usability

The site is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.   
This can be seen with the @media screen resolutions stated on the css stylesheet that tell the browser the settings for each element depending on what the devices screen size is. So if the screen size is around 1025px or more, the content would be big and fit the screen, on the other hand if the screen size is around 600px or less the content would be smaller on small screens but still be visible and readable due to the values given to the elements.

## Features of the site

* Feature 1 - easy navigation through all pages
* Feature 2 - easy access to social media accounts via hyperlinks on the contacts page and the footer 
* Feature 3 - responsive on both desktop and mobiles
* Feature 4 - readable content for all users 

## Software used to code

* Visual Studio Code
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* Git
* Github

## Testing of the site

I tested my website using online tools such as: 
* [HTML WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [CSS WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

After testing each page of my website on the [HTML WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), it came back with no errors. However on the contact me page it bought up errors with putting text in between listing elements, but it's fine as text is needed to explain what the list will be of. 

The website was also put through the [CSS WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and it came back with no errors.

## Deployment

The website was made using Visual Studio Code, a local git directory was used for version control and then bought to life using Github after the files were uploaded into a repository. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status'  to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository.  
After realising I had source control on Visual Studio Code, I was committing to my github repository via the source control tool from Git adding my commits with a message of what change I made to the code. 

## Credits

I got the template for the website from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_start_page&stacked=h).
